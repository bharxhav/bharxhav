I blog very interesting engineering methods at [isthisan.ai](https://isthisan.ai)

#### MISSION 2025

- [5ki](https://5ki.org) is wikipedia but "explain like i'm 5."
- [the intxr.net](https://intxr.net) is a collection of free, local, and open-source tools on the web.
- open sourcing design principles so that [sucky design](https://sucky.design) would not be your problem.
- [sygyzy](https://sygyzy.com) applies mathematical principles to artistic theory.
- [uvxl](https://uvxl.org) is a design language built to condense information and scale cognition.
